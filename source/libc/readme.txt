This folder contains a very tiny program which is only used for testing compiling a C program.

It can be compiled easily using gcc or clang if they are installed on Linux(or Windows if you are brave).

gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main && ./main

clang -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main && ./main

In the future, I will add details about compiling with the Microsoft Visual C compiler, known as "cl".
