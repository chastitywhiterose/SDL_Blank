# SDL_Blank
Empty SDL program for my own convenience starting new projects.

This project contains the starting point of programs I will write in the future. Two valid ways of creating a window and drawing a color using SDL are included.
Also included is just a plain "Hello World" style program for testing the compiler before SDL is added.

These are really just for my own personal use but others may find them useful.
